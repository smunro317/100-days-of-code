# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've now finished the basic HTML portion of freecodecamp, so today I continued on to the CSS curriculum for an hour. So far I'm 42 challenges in.  My work attached:

**Thoughts:** I didn't really think I enjoyed CSS that much until today, as I finally managed to make my project page look nice.  The curriculum is pretty funny, programming tutorials always throw in nerdy humor so this coincidentally was cat-obsessive. Regardless, I think I'm going to begin focusing on Python more, I'd like to get a taste of something outside of front-end development.

### Day 1: September 30, 2019 : Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on python, learned about imports, loops, randomizations, more if/then statements.  Today was the first day I've learned about/used "userInput()," which was really interesting.  

**Thoughts**: Python's confusing for the time being, but I think once I get a little more time I'll be pretty strong at it.  I'm really curious what all it can do as far as programming.

**Link(s) to work**: This one's on my server, but I'll upload a pic to show my progress as soon as I have time tonight.
    #Pic of python script I did today, interesting stuff.  In the meanwhile here's a link to my first commands ever with python.  Pretty lame: http://pages.iu.edu/~sjmunro/i101/py1.html


### Day 2: October 1, 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: What is VSCode... How do I download Python to it? What's the difference between Github and Git?!
<p><h2><b>WHY DOESN'T MY GITHUB CODE WORK LIKE IT DID IN THE TERMINAL?!?</b></h2><p>
<br/>
Three of <b>one thousand</b> questions I've accumulated, there's so much to learn before I can even begin uploading and working on all of the platforms. I'm out of class at 8:00pm, so this should be updated with answers around 10:00.  Let's get it.
