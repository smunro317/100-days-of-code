# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've now finished the basic HTML portion of freecodecamp, so today I continued on to the CSS curriculum for an hour. So far I'm 42 challenges in.  My work attached:

**Thoughts:** I didn't really think I enjoyed CSS that much until today, as I finally managed to make my project page look nice.  The curriculum is pretty funny, programming tutorials always throw in nerdy humor so this coincidentally was cat-obsessive. Regardless, I think I'm going to begin focusing on Python more, I'd like to get a taste of something outside of front-end development.

### Day 1: September 30, 2019 : Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on python, learned about imports, loops, randomizations, more if/then statements.  Today was the first day I've learned about/used "userInput()," which was really interesting.  

**Thoughts**: Python's confusing for the time being, but I think once I get a little more time I'll be pretty strong at it.  I'm really curious what all it can do as far as programming.

**Link(s) to work**: This one's on my server, but I'll upload a pic to show my progress as soon as I have time tonight.
    #Pic of python script I did today, interesting stuff.  In the meanwhile here's a link to my first commands ever with python.  Pretty lame: http://pages.iu.edu/~sjmunro/i101/py1.html


### Day 2: October 1, 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: What is VSCode... How do I download Python to it? What's the difference between Github and Git?!
<p><h4><b>WHY DOESN'T MY GITHUB CODE WORK LIKE IT DID IN THE TERMINAL?!?</b></h4><p>
Three of <b>one thousand</b> questions I've accumulated, there's so much to learn before I can even begin uploading and working on all of the platforms. <i>Regardless</i>, I've been working on Python today. I'm playing with randomizations, loops, etc. once again to make sure I have them down.  Going to put in extra time today, but I'll upload a pic of my progress:

Considering it's been well over an hour today i'm pretty happy.  I've made a lot of progress and can even do some while loops without referencing my notes.. They have to be 100% basic though.  Going to watch some syntax videos tomorrow.  Hasta la vista.

### Day 3: October 2, 2019 : Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: If last nights programming ran through 2:00AM this morning, then does that count as today's hour?.. Nah, let's get started.  We're back on CSS trying to actually style pages and make them look nice.  I worked with some Python to start out, using lists in conjunction with randomization and sentences, then moved onto CSS and played with padding, margins, and attribute selectors which I had never heard of..  Good stuff.

**Thoughts**: Had a busy day so I didn't think I'd be able to put time into this.. Had to pull through it though.  Stayed up late and managed to get more work done than I initially thought I would, very relieved.

### Day 4: October 3, 2019: Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I had class until 10:00 then ubered until 3:00AM but you know what, we gotta learn.  So I practiced CSS on freecodecamp until 4:40AM, yikes.  Today I finished the Basic CSS curriculum, and progressed a little under halfway through the applied visual design curriculum.  Things are going well, that was quite a bit of progress.  As soon as I pick back up on my lessons, I'll be working on "offset" commands.

**Thoughts**: No Python today, sad times.  Considering how much progress we made in CSS though i'd say it was well worth it.  Very sleepy, going to bed.

### Day 5: October 4, 2019: Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've said I would begin doing my hour of code earlier, so as to prevent going to sleep at 3AM.  Unfortunately, today did not mark the beginning of that trend.  It's 3AM. I continued my journey through applied visual design, and began toying with making shapes.  Working with a lot of box-shadow, transparency, et cetera.

**Thoughts**: I made my first shape, a crescent moon, out a weird arrangement of commands for two box shapes.  My next lesson is creating a heart, but it seems like a pretty extensive lesson.  I decided I'd save it for tomorrow so I can soak up all of the info.  Anyways, I'm up early tomorrow.  Hasta manana.

###Day 6: October 5, 2019: Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the applied visual design curriculum today! It finished with animations, so I was using a lot of new commands: ::before/after, @keyframes, timings and more.  It's cool being able to see your work in motion; I made animated a ball to bounce, a heart to beat, some stars to twinkle, and a couple of other challenges as well.  Good stuff.

**Thoughts**: It's kind of nice making something that's visually appealing.  The only sections left in the responsive web design certification are "applied accessibility," responsive web design principles," CSS flexbox," CSS grid," and a couple of challenges, but they're all significantly shorter than the sections I've finished so far.  I'm far beyond halfway done, let's get it.

###Day 7: December 1, 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Yoohoo! After taking a long break from this I'm back.  Not necessarily proud of the break, but I was busy with school.  I read through part of Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" I worked through chapter 1, learning about data, and learning minor rules to Python.  A lot of it was review, but I learned some things we never discussed in class.  I made a fairly basic hello world program that takes input and adds.

**Thoughts**: I've been intending to get back into this.. It's hard getting back into the swing of things and making myself code, but I'm glad I did it.  Will hopefully have less road blocks in the upcoming months.  Going to continue working through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (ATBSWP).

###Day 8: December 2, 2019: Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I mainly did a bunch of reading.  A lot of it was on reddit about how-tos, but most of it was once again on ATBSWP. I've started something to add some excitement into my learning, so from now on I will be doing challenges to test myself and to promote active research and learning.  I'll provide the link to the challenge repository I will be creating.  I only made it a couple of lines into the challenge today, I'll have to think more about how to do this, but it's challenging.

**Thoughts**: Excited to give myself a challenge!
