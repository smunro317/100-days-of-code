# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've now finished the basic HTML portion of freecodecamp, so today I continued on to the CSS curriculum for an hour. So far I'm 42 challenges in.  My work attached:

**Thoughts:** I didn't really think I enjoyed CSS that much until today, as I finally managed to make my project page look nice.  The curriculum is pretty funny, programming tutorials always throw in nerdy humor so this coincidentally was cat-obsessive. Regardless, I think I'm going to begin focusing on Python more, I'd like to get a taste of something outside of front-end development.

      #Need to add an image here for day 1, need to figure out this log's controls though.

                    
### Day 1: September 30, 2019 : Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on python, learned about imports, loops, randomizations, more if/then statements.  Today was the first day I've learned about/used "userInput()," which was really interesting.  

**Thoughts**: Python's confusing for the time being, but I think once I get a little more time I'll be pretty strong at it.  I'm really curious what all it can do as far as programming.

**Link(s) to work**: This one's on my server, but I'll upload a pic to show my progress as soon as I have time tonight.
    #Pic of python script I did today, interesting stuff.  In the meanwhile here's a link to my first commands ever with python.  Pretty lame: http://pages.iu.edu/~sjmunro/i101/py1.html


### Day 2: October 1, 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: What is VSCode... How do I download Python to it? What's the difference between Github and Git?!
<p><h4><b>WHY DOESN'T MY GITHUB CODE WORK LIKE IT DID IN THE TERMINAL?!?</b></h4><p>
Three of <b>one thousand</b> questions I've accumulated, there's so much to learn before I can even begin uploading and working on all of the platforms. <i>Regardless</i>, I've been working on Python today. I'm playing with randomizations, loops, etc. once again to make sure I have them down.  Going to put in extra time today, but I'll upload a pic of my progress:

Considering it's been well over an hour today i'm pretty happy.  I've made a lot of progress and can even do some while loops without referencing my notes.. They have to be 100% basic though.  Going to watch some syntax videos tomorrow.  Hasta la vista.

### Day 3: October 2, 2019 : Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: If last nights programming ran through 2:00AM this morning, then does that count as today's hour?.. Nah, let's get started.  We're back on CSS trying to actually style pages and make them look nice.  I worked with some Python to start out, using lists in conjunction with randomization and sentences, then moved onto CSS and played with padding, margins, and attribute selectors which I had never heard of..  Good stuff.

**Thoughts**: Had a busy day so I didn't think I'd be able to put time into this.. Had to pull through it though.  Stayed up late and managed to get more work done than I initially thought I would, very relieved.
